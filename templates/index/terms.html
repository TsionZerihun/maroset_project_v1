                    <p> Job seeker protection </p>
                    <p>Employers are strictly prohibited from asking job seekers to pay any fees during the application process. This includes fees for background checks, training, equipment, or any other costs associated with the job. This policy is in place to ensure that job seekers are not taken advantage of and do not have to pay any money to apply for a job. Any employer found violating this policy will be immediately removed from the platform and may face legal action. The platform takes this policy very seriously and will not tolerate any employer who tries to take advantage of job seekers by asking them to pay fees. Job seekers who encounter employers asking for fees or membership in order to apply for a job are encouraged to report the activity to the platform&#39;s customer support team. The platform takes all reports of this nature seriously and will investigate any claims of fraudulent activity. </p>
                    <p> Communication Expectations</p>
                    <p>At Maroset Platform, we value open and transparent communication between employers and applicants. Timely and respectful communication is essential for creating a positive and efficient hiring process. Employers should aim to respond to job applications within 5 business days. We encourage employers to prioritize timely communication to maintain a professional and efficient hiring process. Employers are expected to acknowledge the receipt of job applications promptly. This helps applicants know that their application has been received and is being considered. Employers who have shortlisted or hired should immediately close the vacancy without meandering new applicants.</p>
                    <p>Employers should provide regular updates to applicants regarding the status of their application. This can include informing applicants about the progress of the hiring process, any changes in timelines, or if their application is no longer under consideration. Employers are encouraged to provide constructive feedback to applicants, even if they are not selected for the position. This feedback can help applicants improve their future job applications and enhance their professional growth. Employers who consistently fail to respond to applicants without a valid reason may receive a warning from Maroset Platform. </p>
                    <p>In case of continued non-responsiveness, employers&#39; accounts may be temporarily suspended, preventing them from accessing the platform and posting new job listings. If the use of non-responsiveness persists despite warnings and temporary suspensions, Maroset Platform reserves the right to permanently remove the employer&#39;s account from the platform.</p>
                    <p><br></p>
                    <p> Reporting Mechanism</p>
                    <p>Applicants who have not received a response from an employer within the specified timeframe can report the issue to Maroset Platform through our dedicated support/Feedback section. We take such reports seriously and will investigate the matter to ensure a fair and respectful experience for all users.</p>
                    <p><br></p>
                    <p> Dispute Resolution</p>
